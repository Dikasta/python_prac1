1. Given a set of numbers -50 to 50, find all pairs that add up to a certain sum that is passed in. What's the O notation for what you just wrote? Can you make it faster? Can you find an O(n) solution? Implement the O(n) solution

2. There are 20 different socks of two types in a drawer in a completely dark room. What is the minimum number of socks you should grab to ensure you have a matching pair?"

3.Describe and code an algorithm that returns the first duplicate character in a string?

4. In a given sorted array of integers remove all the duplicates.

5.Consider a stack of N number of cards which are piled up and in facing down. Each card has a unique number from the range 1 to N. The card is stacked in such a way that it exhibits the following behavior: Take the first card and put it under the stack without revealing. Now the next card on the top will have the number 1 on it. Next take 2 cards one after the other and put is under the stack without revealing. Yes you guessed it right - the next card on the top will reveal a value of 2. This goes on. Eg. for such a series : 9,1,8,5,2,4,7,6,3,10 [for N=10] Write a program to generate such a series for a given N number of cards so that this behavior can be exercised.

6. Merge two sorted linked list. The merged list should also be sorted. * Compact a string. i.e remove spaces * traverse a link list containing char* as data. test cases for the same. * reverse a string. test cases for the same. * remove all the given characters from a string.

7. given two linked lists with a digit in each node, add the two linked lists together. the result must be a linked list with one digit in each node. use only one iteration of the two input lists.

8.Are two words palindrome of each other?
